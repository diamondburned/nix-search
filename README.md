A better and channel-compatible `nix search` for NixOS using only stable Nix
tools.

## Why?

I cannot get Flakes to work, no one was able to help me for days, so I decided
to [fix the Nix channels issues
myself](https://github.com/diamondburned/nix-bonito).

Unstable Nix versions (2.4+) break all of `nix`'s subcommands including `nix
search`, so I decided to make a better `nix search` that works with stable Nix
versions.

## Goals

The goals of `nix-search` is to be fast and useful. Nix 2.3's `nix search` is
rather weak and slow in its searching capabilities, and Nix 2.4's `nix search`
is even slower, so this aims to be better than that.

`nix-search` goes with an indexing-based approach, where it indexes packages
and their attributes into a searching database. This allows for faster
searching and more accurate results.
[Bluge](https://github.com/blugelabs/bluge) is used for the indexing.

`nix-search` will also eventually feature a lightweight expression evaluator
that will allow for more accurate results. This will allow for more flexible
queries, such as `nix-search -e 'description contains "foo" and name contains
"bar"'`.

## Installation

### Nix

You can install `nix-search` like so:

```nix
let
  nix-search = import (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "diamondburned";
    repo = "nix-search";
    rev = "<REV>";
    sha256 = "<SHA256>";
  });
in

{
  environment.systemPackages = [ nix-search ];
}
```

If you're using Flakes, you can also add `github:diamondburned/nix-flakes` as
an input and use `nix-flakes.packages.${system}.default`.

### Go

```sh
go install libdb.so/nix-search/cmd/nix-search@latest
```

## Usage

First, index the Nixpkgs tree:

```sh
nix-search --index
```

If you use Nix Flakes, then you can index the `nixpkgs` flake instead:

```sh
nix-search --index --flake nixpkgs
```

Then, search for packages:

```sh
nix-search firefox
```

## Performance

`nix-search` is reasonably fast. It takes about 20 seconds to index the entire
Nixpkgs tree, and searching is almost instantaneous.
